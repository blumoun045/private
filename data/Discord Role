Experienced full-stack web developer adept in all stages of advanced web development.
Knowledgeable in user interface, testing, and debugging processes. Bringing forth expertise in design, installation, testing and maintenance of web systems. 
Equipped with a diverse and promising skill-set. Proficient in an assortment of technologies, including JavaScript, Python, React.js, Angular, Asp.net, Android, Flutter, React Native, Node.js etc. 
Able to effectively self-manage during independent projects, as well as collaborate in a team setting.
Individually, I claim that the code must be clean. For clean code, it is to not blindly follow the code in a codebase as the standard. I think the code should not only work properly but also should be easy to read and scalable. I really hate the code that works but very hard to read.

I have a proactive availability: 6 days a week, 8+ hours a day for work, 12+ hours a day for communication. I have very flexible working times.

If my skills and experience match your requirements, please reach me out.
